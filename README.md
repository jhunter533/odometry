# odometry
There are two branches. The main contains the recently updated Odometry file using proper objects and classes.
The other branch contains old verisons.
Odometry follows a two wheel, inertial pattern. One wheel for y axis and the other for x axis along with inertial sensor to tell heading.
All code was written for vex v5 System.
As such it uses two quad encoders and the vex v5 inertial sensor following a tank drive chassis.
