# odometry

The newest file is the one with a different naming system.
Old file versions are kept to see the logic changes since previous versions may hold good methods or such for other projects
Odometry follows a two wheel, inertial pattern. One wheel for y axis and the other for x axis along with inertial sensor to tell heading.
All code was written for vex v5 System.
As such it uses two quad encoders and the vex v5 inertial sensor following a tank drive chassis.
